# Fritz's talk at Prodigy based on 99 Bottles 

## Session 1

Checkout the code:

    git clone git@github.com:iftheshoefritz/99bottles.git
    git checkout pre-exercise

Make sure you can run the tests:

    > ruby test/bottles_test.rb

IN THE KATA: (you can start early if you want)

Edit lib/bottles.rb to make the test pass.

(whitespace is significant in the verses)

As soon as you pass one test, delete the “skip” keyword from the next test and run the tests again.
